# JavaScript Practice Before DSA 🚀

This repository contains my personal JavaScript concept practice — all the fundamental problems and logic building exercises I'm solving **before starting Data Structures & Algorithms**.

These questions are **not limited to 100** — the goal is mastery, not numbers.

## 📚 Why This Repo?

Before jumping into DSA, it's important to have a solid grip on:
- Core JavaScript syntax and logic
- Problem solving using conditions, loops, arrays, objects
- Understanding functions, scopes, closures, etc.

This repo helps me track that journey.
